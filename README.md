The SWAT-MAD-CO2-GW model has been enhanced with an improved auto-irrigation algorithm, groundwater module, and dynamic CO2 module.
In contrast, the SWAT-MAD-CO2-GW-FT model incorporates further improvements, including an enhanced auto-irrigation algorithm, groundwater module, dynamic CO2 module, and the integration of a physically-based freeze-thaw cycle module.
